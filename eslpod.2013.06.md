  Yves: Help me fill out this application for our **marriage license**.
  
  Vanessa: Can't you do it? I'm really busy with work right now. Do as much as you can and just ask me if you don't know something.
  
  Yves: Okay, I'll try, but I'm reading through the requirements, and it's a good idea for both of us to know what they are.
  
  Vanessa: Okay, then just read them **out loud** to me.
